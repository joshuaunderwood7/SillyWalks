This program takes an input LL1 grammar and a source program and generates
a fake intermediate language (for now).  

FunnyWalks is free.  As such it is licensed as GPLv3 or latter.

FunnyWalks is designed to allow the grammar to be changed on the fly.

currently it is being made for a Universal Compiler class being taken
at the university of Colorado, Denver under the instruction of Dr. Boris
Stilman.

To do:
-make scanner/lexer dependent on the input grammar.
-create scoping for sub-programs.
-output assembly in code generation, for a target system.
-optimize to exploit Python's strengths (currently made to assignment specs)
-add documentation/comments.
